# Javascript Flashcards

#### Portfolio Project for Epicodus - 2019-0115

#### By Tracy Reith and Chris Breaux

## Description

Javascript and jQuery terms and definitions, laid out as "flashcards." Created for Epicodus Front End Development course.

As of Jan 15 2019, needs all definitions. I would like to add some animation to make the cards appear to flip. I need work on "mouseenter" and "mouseleave" events to make the hover effect on the terms appear when the user mouses into a card. To get the cards to center horizontally on the page, I will need to apply Flexbox to the layout.
